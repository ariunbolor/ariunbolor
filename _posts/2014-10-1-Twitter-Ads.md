Couple weeks ago I've decided to try a Twitter ads. I started promoting my web site without too many configurations on twitter ad settings. I got not too much impression or engagements on th web site but lost too much money in too it. Then I realized to go through all the settings to narrow it down. 

Also I've noticed that 99% of impressions made by iPhone, iPad, Mobile devices. 

I setup the configuration with Desktop only since my web site is for desktop users.

After this settings I stopped loosing money because I'm barely getting engagements from ads. 

FYI: Twitter ad works for twitter account pormotion or quick heads up with tweet engagement. Better don't try to promote you web site link or something external. Also I've noticed that the geographic location shows New York, NY all the time on the graphic. But if you see the geographic detail you will see the real locations.
