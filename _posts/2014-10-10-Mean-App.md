MEAN stands for MongoDB , ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJs. MEAN is an opinionated fullstack javascript framework - 
which simplifies and accelerates web application development. 

Very first you have to setup local environment with MongoDB and NodeJS. Please check and install NodeJS from www.nodejs.orj.

Install MongoDB on your local machine. Due to install MongoDB you'll need to install HomeBrew first. 

Install homebrew 

{% highlight ruby %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

Now this is the time to install MongoDB
To install the MongoDB binaries, issue the following command in a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew update
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb
{% endhighlight %}

To build MongoDB from the source files and include SSL support, issue the following from a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb --with-openssl
{% endhighlight %}

To install the latest development release for use in testing and development, issue the following command in a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb --devel
{% endhighlight %}

Now we're ready to install MEAN app on your local machine. 

To install MEAN app scaffold

{% highlight ruby %}
$sudo npm install -g meanio
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can initiliaze your MEAN app
{% highlight ruby %}
$ mean init myApp
{% endhighlight %}

#Setup Heroku Account

In order to work with Heroku, you also need to download Heroku’s toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com) which will give you the needed command line tools to communicate with Heroku’s backend. Right after registering in Heroku and installing it’s toolbelt, run the following command and add your SSH key, to identify yourself with Heroku:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ heroku login
{% endhighlight %}

You'll need your email address and password for Heroku. Before you push your repo, you need to add public key into your heroku.

Generate the RSA key first by following

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
{% endhighlight %}

Add your key to heroku

{% highlight ruby %}
$ heroku keys:add
{% endhighlight %}

Read more about SSH key https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys

{% highlight php %}
$ heroku create myApp
{% endhighlight %}

Now you're ready to push your code into your Heroku

#Prepare to push Heroku

{% highlight javascript %}
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -a -m "Fresh start"
{% endhighlight %}
