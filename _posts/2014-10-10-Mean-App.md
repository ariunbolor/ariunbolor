MEAN stands for MongoDB , ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJs. MEAN is an opinionated fullstack javascript framework - 
which simplifies and accelerates web application development. 

Very first you have to setup local environment with MongoDB and NodeJS. Please check and install NodeJS from www.nodejs.org.

Install MongoDB on your local machine. Due to install MongoDB you'll need to install HomeBrew first. 

Install homebrew 

{% highlight ruby %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

Now this is the time to install MongoDB
To install the MongoDB binaries, issue the following command in a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew update
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb
{% endhighlight %}

To build MongoDB from the source files and include SSL support, issue the following from a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb --with-openssl
{% endhighlight %}

To install the latest development release for use in testing and development, issue the following command in a system shell:

{% highlight ruby %}
brew install mongodb --devel
{% endhighlight %}

Now we're ready to install MEAN app on your local machine. 

To install MEAN app scaffold

{% highlight ruby %}
$sudo npm install -g meanio
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can initiliaze your MEAN app
{% highlight ruby %}
$ mean init myApp
{% endhighlight %}

#Setup Heroku Account

In order to work with Heroku, you also need to download Heroku’s toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com) which will give you the needed command line tools to communicate with Heroku’s backend. Right after registering in Heroku and installing it’s toolbelt, run the following command and add your SSH key, to identify yourself with Heroku:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ heroku login
{% endhighlight %}

You'll need your email address and password for Heroku. Before you push your repo, you need to add public key into your heroku.

Generate the RSA key first by following

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
{% endhighlight %}

Add your key to heroku

{% highlight ruby %}
$ heroku keys:add
{% endhighlight %}

Read more about SSH key https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys

Before you go further let's setup your database on Heroku. 

Login to your Heroku dashboard goto Add-ons tab and find MongoHQ under Data Stores. Select free plan and add to your package. Now go to your apps. Select MongoHQ from your app list. 

Goto Admin tab (on the left side) and select Users tab on top of the panel. From here you can setup your MongoDM access by adding a user.

Copy your Mongo URI
{% highlight html %}
mongodb://<user>:<password>@linus.mongohq.com:XXXX/appXXXXXXX
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}
$ heroku create myApp
{% endhighlight %}

Now you're ready to push your code into your Heroku

#Setup your MEAN App config 

Very first you have to setup your MongoDB on your config to run your scaffold app. 

go to /yourApp/config/env/development.js 

find mongodb:localhost

replace with your MongoURI  

#Prepare to push Heroku

{% highlight javascript %}
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -a -m "Fresh start"
{% endhighlight %}

Now this is a time to push it

{% highlight bash %}
$ git push heroku master
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can see your project http://yourApp.herokuapp.com

Enjoy playing around
